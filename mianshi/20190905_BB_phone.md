# Summary
- If you know the brute force approach and you could not come up with a faster one, go with brute force first!
    - You may not be able to come up a faster solution, or the 'brute force' is actually a good choice. You may waste too much time if you wait
- Review fundamental knowledge please. It is so painful if you fail because you do not know what is mergesort.
- BB interviewer thought you are not a major convertor, so prepare the system design

## Talk about your project at AMD
- How did you optimize the code
- How did you validate the code
- What are the main conclusions in your paper

## Why BB

## Coding question:
- a list of credit numbers, display the minimum amount of digits so that it is unique in the list
- example: input [9389, 1279, 6528, 1747, 0368], output [89, 79, 28, 7, 68]
- My code:
```python
def creditCards(numbers):


```

## Other technical questions
### What is mergesort? What is quicksort? Their own time complexity
