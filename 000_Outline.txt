Due to the work load of ME interviews, I do more easy questions these days.
136 Single Number: 
  You may choose either less memory, or shorter run time. Hard to get both. Leetcode has a few solutions and it may worth to take a look, especially for the hash table one, and the logic relation one.
017 Letter Combination of a Phone Number: 
  May check if others have anything faster than O(n**3)

049 Group Anagram:
  Spent a lot of time on comparing letter by letter in strings, while finally figured out that it can be easily solved by dictionary. Each dict key is the sorted string. Then output is the list of values for each key.
048 Rotate Image:
  Assign some value to a variable: assign the value itself or assign the memory location?
  One line to loop over lists in list
  Sometimes it is useful to calculate the first few items in hand writing and then try to find the rule or equaion for bigger set.
  Another solution uses zip command in Python. Should learn about how to use it.

No update. Did some heavy house work.

070 Climbing Stairs
  It is a fibonacci list. Like what I found in 048, it is useful to calculate the first few items and find the rules.
  Later, it may be useful to try dynamic programming

961 N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array
  Not so challenge. a easy question. Easier than what the question describes.
